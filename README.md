# Space Agency Portal

This is a simple React app created with Vite, featuring:
- Animated stars and a planet using framer-motion
- Light and dark space-inspired themes
- Modern, clean UI with a theme toggle

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Customization
- All main logic is in `src/App.jsx`.
- Styling is handled with styled-components.
- Animations use framer-motion.
